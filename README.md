# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Homework

okay, so I sort of had an initial problem with the upload to git of the resources folder provided in the gitlab section, the 5 csv's of the 5 quarters. 
I didn't know if having them in the zipped format would work for the graders when they looked through the assignment so I went ahead and unzipped them, also I dont know how,
or if it is even possible to unzip a file in a remote git repository so I figured again that it would be best to unzip before pushing. 
Git didn't like that, so I unstaged them and pushed as the zipped format and no issue.

Also, I know that there is a workaround regarding the zip/unzipped with the git-Ifs-wondows-v3.02.exe application but Ive only used that once and since it might not even be necessary,
ill save that as a last resort.
